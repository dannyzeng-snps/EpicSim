1.0 Building/Installing EpicSim From Source

If you are starting from the source, the build process is designed to be
as simple as practical. Someone basically familiar with the target
system and C/C++ compilation should be able to build the source
distribution with little effort. Some actual programming skills are
not required, but helpful in case of problems.

2.1 Compile Time Prerequisites

You need the following software to compile EpicSim from source
on a UNIX-like system:

        - CMake
	- GNU Make
	- ISO C++ Compiler
	- bison and flex
	- gperf 3.0 or later
	- readline 4.2 or later
	- termcap
	- bash

2.2 Compilation

Unpack the tar-ball and cd the directory and compile the source
with the commands:

  mkdir build
  cd build
  cmake ..
  make install
  cd ..
  export PATH="`pwd`/install/bin:$PATH"
  epicsim -v
